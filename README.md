# I2C Example

**Square a number at the other Arduino and send the result back.**

See [this tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-ble-sense/I2C) for hardware and software set up. Everything is the same except that you need to replace the reader and writer code with ones found in this repo.

# Credits
Based on the official Arduino tutorial: [Connecting two Nano 33 BLE Sense boards trough I2C](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-ble-sense/I2C). Adapted to square a number at the other Arduino and send the result back.
